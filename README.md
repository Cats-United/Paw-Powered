My account, also known as the "Webmaster's" account.

Developers, members who added their own game to fur-powered.
Collaborations, which sould be ignored for now.

More about Fur-Powered:

Fur-Powered uses "Factories" for Developers and Animators, showing off their games, apps, and animations
Apps do not fit in games and animations, like art programs.
Games are fun, interactive, and are playable. Apps like simulation, action, RPG, and the list goes on, are games.
Animations are like videos/movies. Making a seiries grant you the abillities to make a artist's lounge(Profile part comming soon!),a special page/place that shows of your animations/series.
Fur-Powered is a JFF project, so no one has to worry about it being taken seriously.
Fur-Powered is open-sourced
Anyone is welcome to join and help!
Fur-Powered is owned by FunDog Games (FDG), and is an exstenion to the site
